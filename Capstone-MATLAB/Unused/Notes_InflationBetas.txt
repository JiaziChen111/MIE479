Notes on Inflation and Individual Equities (Andrew Ang & co.)
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
-time variation of stock inflation betas is substantial

-GOAL: constructing portfolios based on individual stocks whose returns covary strongly with inflation(this has the potential to provide a much better inflation hedge than the aggregate market)
—Although overall stock market may be poor inflation hedge, companies in certain sectors or with certain characteristics may have better inflation hedging properties than other companies

-Generally, non-cyclical stocks covary positively with inflation where the contrary is true for cyclical stocks
-Natural resources stocks are also considered good inflation hedgers

-To measure the inflation hedging ability of individual stocks, compute stock-level inflation betas using the Bekaert and Wang method and then group stocks into portfolios ranking on inflation betas.
—-we rank stocks into quintile portfolios, based on realized, ex-post inflation betas

The quintile portfolio with the highest ex-post inflation beta has had a positive correlation with inflation and has an inflation beta of 1.65

Note that inflation betas exhibit pronounced time variation. As many as 20% of stocks, on average, exhibit sign change in inflation betas from year to year.
